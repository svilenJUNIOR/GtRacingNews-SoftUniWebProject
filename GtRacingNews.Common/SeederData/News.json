Third place in a nail-biting, season-closing race at the Nürburgring in Germany sealed the title win for Nissan after a season of hard racing in what is accepted to be the biggest GT championship in the world.Nissan has previously taken the GT4 European title and more recently the Blancpain Endurance PRO AM title. This year is the Nissan GT Academy Team RJN's first attempt at the PRO title, so it is a huge accomplishment to win in its debut PRO season.The Nissan drivers set themselves up for a good race when Buncombe took second overall in qualifying, bagging a front row starting spot for the #23 GT-R. Gaetan Paletou (FRA) then continued the great form he has shown at the Nürburgring, taking the PRO AM pole position, which was eighth place on the overall grid.",

    "Description": "After a severely disrupted season last year, 2021 is a year of fresh optimism for the Orange1 FFF Racing Team as it embarks on another Intercontinental GT Challenge campaign with a full Lamborghini Factory Driver line-up to lead the charge. The series, promoted by the Stéphane Ratel Organisation will be disputed over four events, starting with the iconic 24 Hours of Spa, following the cancellation of the Bathurst 12 Hours. IGTC pitches Lamborghini against some of the world’s best manufacturers and is regarded as the pinnacle of GT racing. Also on the 2021 agenda will be the 10 Hours of Suzuka in Japan on the weekend of 20-22nd August, the 8 Hours of Indianapolis in September before concluding on the opening weekend of December with the 9 Hours of Kyalami in South Africa, making it a true global series.Once again, the Chinese team’s line-up will feature a 100% Lamborghini Factory Driver roster, with team co-owner Andrea Caldarelli joined by Marco Mapelli and Mirko Bortolotti. Caldarelli and Mapelli secured an historic unofficial triple crown of GT World Challenge Europe titles – the Sprint, Endurance and Overall crowns – in 2019, becoming the first crew to win both the Sprint and Endurance championships in the same year. Alongside returning Factory Driver Bortolotti, they will be looking to add the Intercontinental GT Challenge title to the team’s ever-increasing résumé in 2021.Bortolotti is also no stranger to Orange1 FFF Racing Team, having driven for the team at Macau at the end of the 2016 season before making a second appearance the following year. Bortolotti is also former GT World Challenge Endurance Cup champion – with Grasser Racing Team in 2017 alongside Caldarelli.",
